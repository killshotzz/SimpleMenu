# SimpleMenu
## What is SimpleMenu?

SimpleMenu is a easy script that is written in SourcePawn, and allows you to create a menu in CS:GO and other Sourcemod/SourcePawn based games. The script itself is fairly easy, and the upload is only a script I made for a community I play with.

## How does it work?

It's fairly simple, as the name of the plugin suggest. You take the template and generate the menu structure, commands etc. as you please. And then you compile it.

### Installation

Download the .SP file, and start editing it with SPEdit (https://github.com/JulienKluge/Spedit) - When you are done, you can compile it (https://spider.limetech.io/).
When done compiling, put the .sp file in addons/sourcemod/scripting. And then put the .smx file you compiled into addons/sourcemod/plugins.

### Commands

* sm_main, sm_setup, sm_configs in the template that is provided.
* You can generate all the other you want.

## Note About The Current State

This plugin is an fairly simple plugin, if you can even call it a plugin. It is just a code written, to make it easier for both me and others to generate menus in CS:GO and other SP/SMX based games.
